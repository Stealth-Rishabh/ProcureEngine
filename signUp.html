                    <p class="ppolicy-text">AgileApt follows different principles in accordance with world-wide practices to protect customer privacy and data protection.</p>
                    <ul class="ppolicy-list">
                        <li>We won&apos;t sell or give away your name, mail address, phone number, email address, credit card number or any other information to anyone without your written consent.</li>

                    </ul>

                    <p class="ppolicy-text">Generally the  information that personally identifies you and allows us to contact you ,is requested when you create a Registration ID on the site or when you download free software, enter a contest, order e-mail newsletters or join a limited-access premium site. </p>
                    <p class="ppolicy-text">We use your Personal Information for four primary purposes:</p>

                    <ul class="ppolicy-list">
                        <li>To make the site easier for you to use by not having to enter information more than once.</li>
                        <li>To help you quickly find software, services or information.</li>
                        <li>To help us create content most relevant to you.</li>
                        <li>To alert you to product upgrades, special offers, updated information and other new services from AgileApt.</li>
                    </ul>
                    <h4 class="ppolicy-head4">CONSENT</h4>
                    <p class="ppolicy-text">If you choose not to register or provide personal information, you can still use most of procurEngine.com. But you will not be able to access areas that require registration. If you decide to register, you will be able to select the kinds of information you want to receive from us by subscribing to various services, like our electronic newsletters. If you do not want us to communicate with you about other offers regarding AgileApt products, programs, events, or services by e-mail, postal mail, or telephone, you may select the option stating that you do not wish to receive marketing messages from AgileApt. AgileApt occasionally allows other companies to offer our registered customers information about their products and services, using postal mail only. If you do not want to receive these offers, you may select the option stating that you do not wish to receive marketing materials from third parties.</p>
                    <h4 class="ppolicy-head4"> CUSTOMER PROFILES</h4>
                    <p class="ppolicy-text">
                        As mentioned above, every registered customer has a unique personal profile. Each profile is
                        assigned a unique personal identification number, which helps us ensure that only you can access
                        your profile. When you register, we create your profile, assign a personal identification number, then
                        send this personal identification number back to your hard drive in the form of a cookie, which is a
                        very small bit of code. This code is uniquely yours. It is your passport to seamless travel across
                        procurEngine.com, allowing you to download free software, order free newsletters, and visit premium sites
                        without having to fill out registration forms with information you’ve already provided. Even if you switch
                        computers, you won’t have to re-register – just use your Registration ID to identify yourself.
                    </p>

                    <p class="ppolicy-text">
                        <strong>What we do with the information you share:</strong> When you join us, you provide us with your contact
                        information, including your name and email address. We use this information to send you updates
                        about your order, questionnaires to measure your satisfaction with our service and announcements
                        about new and exciting services that we offer. When you order from us, we ask for your credit card number and billing address. We use this information only to bill you for the product(s) you order at that
                        time. For your convenience, we do save billing information in case you want to order from us again,
                        but we don’t use this information again without your permission.<br /><br />We occasionally hire other companies to provide limited services on our behalf, including packaging,
                        mailing and delivering purchases, answering customer questions about products or services, sending
                        postal mail and processing event registration. We will only provide those companies the information
                        they need to deliver the service, and they are prohibited from using that information for any other
                        purpose.

                        You may review and update this information at any time at the Visitor Centre. There, you can:

                        <li>Sign up for electronic newsletters about our services and products.</li>

                    <h4 class="ppolicy-head4">SECURITY</h4>

                    <p class="ppolicy-text">
                        AgileApt has taken strong measures to protect the security of your
                        personal information and to ensure that your choices for its intended use are honoured. We take
                        strong precautions to protect your data from loss, misuse, unauthorized access or disclosure,
                        alteration, or destruction.<br /><br />
                        We guarantee your e-commerce transactions to be 100% safe and secure. When you place orders or
                        access your personal account information, you’re utilizing secure server software SSL, which encrypts
                        your personal information before it’s sent over the Internet. SSL is one of the safest encryption
                        technologies available.<br /><br />
                        AgileApt strictly protects the security of your personal information and
                        honours your choices for its intended use. We carefully protect your data from loss, misuse,
                        unauthorized access or disclosure, alteration, or destruction.<br /><br />
                        Your personal information is never shared outside the company without your permission, except
                        under conditions explained above. Inside the company, data is stored in password-controlled servers
                        with limited access. Your information may be stored and processed in INDIA or any other country
                        where AgileApt, its subsidiaries, affiliates or agents are located.<br /><br />
                        You also have a significant role in protecting your information. No one can see or edit your personal
                        information without knowing your user name and password, so do not share these with others.
                    </p>

                    <h4 class="ppolicy-head4">NOTICE TO PARENTS</h4>
                    <p class="ppolicy-text">
                        Parents or guardians: we want to help you guard your children’s privacy. We encourage you to talk to
                        your children about safe and responsible use of their Personal Information while using the Internet.<br /><br />
                        The AgileApt site does not publish content that is targeted to children.
                        However, if you are concerned about your children providing AgileApt
                        any personal information without your consent, AgileApt offers a Kids
                        account. It allows parents to give parental consent for the collection, use and sharing of children’s
                        (ages 12 and under) personal information online.

                    <p class="ppolicy-text">
                        When you buy and install a new product, we may ask you to register your purchase electronically.
                        When you do, we merge your registration information with any information you’ve already left with us
                        (we call that information your personal profile). If you haven’t previously registered with us, we create
                        a personal profile for you from your product registration information. If you ever want to review or
                        update that information, you can visit the Profile Centre, click on Update Profile, and edit any of the
                        Personal Information in your profile. If you haven’t already created a Registration ID, we will ask you
                        to do so. This ensures that only you can access your information.

                    <p class="ppolicy-text">
                        We provide our Services using a commercially reasonable level of skill and care and we
                        hope that you will enjoy using them. But there are certain things that we don’t promise about
                        our Services.<br /><br />
                        Other than as expressly set out in these terms or additional terms, neither AgileApt nor its
                        suppliers or distributors make any specific promises about the Services. For example, we
                        don’t make any commitments about the content within the Services, the specific functions of
                        the Services, or their reliability, availability, or ability to meet your needs. We provide the
                        Services “as is”.<br /><br />

                        fitness for a particular purpose and non-infringement. To the extent permitted by law, we
                        exclude all warranties.

                    <p class="ppolicy-text">
                        When permitted by law, AgileApt, and AgileApt’s suppliers and distributors, will not be
                        responsible for lost profits, revenues, or data, financial losses or indirect, special,
                        consequential, exemplary, or punitive damages.<br /><br />
                        In all cases, AgileApt, and its suppliers and distributors, will not be liable for any loss or
                        damage that is not reasonably foreseeable.

                        If you are using our Services on behalf of a business, that business accepts these terms. It

                    <p class="ppolicy-text">
                        We may modify these terms or any additional terms that apply to a Service to, for example,
                        reflect changes to the law or changes to our Services. You should look at the terms
                        regularly. We’ll post notice of modifications to these terms on this page. We’ll post notice of
                        modified additional terms in the applicable Service. Changes will not apply retroactively and
                        will become effective no sooner than fourteen days after they are posted. However, changes
                        addressing new functions for a Service or changes made for legal reasons will be effective
                        immediately. If you do not agree to the modified terms for a Service, you should discontinue
                        your use of that Service.<br /><br />If there is a conflict between these terms and the additional terms, the additional terms will
                        control for that conflict.<br /><br />These terms control the relationship between AgileApt and you. They do not create any third
                        party beneficiary rights.<br /><br />If you do not comply with these terms, and we don’t take action right away, this doesn’t
                        mean that we are giving up any rights that we may have (such as taking action in the future).<br /><br />
                        If it turns out that a particular term is not enforceable, this will not affect any other terms.<br /><br />
                        All disputes left after exhausting the remedies under the Indian Arbitration Act, will be subject
                        to the Jurisdiction of Delhi Courts.
