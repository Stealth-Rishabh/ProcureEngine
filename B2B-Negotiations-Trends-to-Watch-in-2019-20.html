                                    <p>B2B Negotiations went through plenty of changes in the last few years with
                                        increased IT penetration in this field. The advent of smart, intelligent and
                                        easy-to-use e-Negotiations platforms have already disrupted this arena, yet it
                                        is far from getting standardized again. Negotiation is expected to go through
                                        big changes now with the advent of Industry 4.0.

                                    <h5 class="mt-4">1. Increased Focus on Comprehensive e-Negotiation</h5>
                                    <p>With the advent of high-speed internet reaching even the remotest places in
                                        India, many large and mid-sized organisations have already moved or started to
                                        move towards e-Negotiations in a big way. The e-Negotiation platforms are
                                        becoming more intelligent and smarter with increased usage. The e-Negotiations
                                        not only provide a fast and efficient tool for the negotiators ensuring good
                                        prices through intra-industry competition but also it creates organisations to
                                        see the cost and advantages to move towards low cost yet efficient substitutes.
                                    </p>
                                    <p>e-Negotiations also helps organisations to record the entire process to avoid
                                        getting tags of being biased and for future audit purposes. Now the focus of the
                                        organisations will on combining AI and HI for a comprehensive outcome.</p>
                                    <h5>2. Data Analytics as a Negotiation Compulsion</h5>
                                    <p>The IT tools have impacted the early days of Negotiations and continue to impact
                                        it now. That doesn’t mean that everyone’s Negotiation is finished digitizing –
                                        far from it – but it does mean that even companies that are miles away from
                                        achieving Industry 4.0 operations are still collecting massive amounts of data.
                                    </p>
                                    <p>In the coming year, we expect that it will become increasingly uncommon for that
                                        data to go unused. Where advanced prescriptive and predictive analytics were
                                        once considered luxuries, they will increasingly be seen as an indispensable
                                        part of administering a negotiation. Why? Because without them, the large caches
                                        of data that are routinely collected across the negotiation couldn’t be
                                        leveraged into value-added propositions like improved purchase cost and higher
                                        efficiency – two things that will be necessary for keeping companies
                                        competitive. </p>

                                    <h5>3. Greater Acceleration of Product Lifecycles</h5>
                                    <p>Just as the new technology is changing the way that we do businesses, it’s also
                                        changing the way that organisations do negotiations with their vendors. The rise
                                        of digital infrastructure has given us the subsequent rise of e-commerce
                                        particularly in B2C space, which has changed and continues to change the way
                                        that customers learn about and ultimately purchase various products.</p>
                                    <p>On similar lines in B2B, as customer expectations evolve, businesses have to
                                        evolve along with them. One of the most significant ways in which changing
                                        customer expectations is driving necessary operational change is the shortening
                                        of product lifecycles.</p>
                                    <p>Manufacturers across multiple industries are discovering that new products and
                                        new innovations need to be turned over much more quickly than ever before, with
                                        many existing products now reaching obsolescence sooner than expected. This new
                                        reality requires a high degree of organisational flexibility and a much
                                        “sharper” value chain than many businesses are used to. Production plans have to
                                        be developed and implemented more quickly and demand needs to be estimated more
                                        precisely in order to account for the low likelihood that a large buffer stock
                                        will come in handy. In order to meet these new requirements, businesses are
                                        going to need smarter Negotiation planning and more intelligent processes, e.g.
                                        real-time demand tracking, “what-if” scenarios, etc.
                                    </p>
                                    <p>This expects to put a lot of pressure on the entire negotiation to approval
                                        cycle. It will also mean that there are now previous price trends or the
                                        conventionally used LPP (last purchase price) for many items. The move has to be
                                        more on price – discoveries.</p>
                                    <h5>4. Focus on Cost Reduction</h5>
                                    <p>With many industries facing imminent global slow-down, there is expected to be a
                                        renewed focus on lowering the cost of production of offered products and
                                        services. This would mean the need for quicker and harsh negotiations. The
                                        vendors will also feel an increased threat of substitutes. Many organisations
                                        may form CFT to drive down the cost. </p>
                                    <p>In our e-Negotiation business also, we have seen many organisations who were
                                        paying huge amounts to e-Negotiations global platforms only because they use
                                        their ERP system, are evaluating the small yet reliable cloud-based
                                        e-Negotiation platform, whose subscription cost is just a fraction the large
                                        giants, yet offer lot more features, without any need of additional hardware or
                                        software.</p>
                                    <h5>5. Greater Vendor Segmentation and RM standardization</h5>
                                    <p>The Supply Chain heads of the future won’t be interested in customization of the
                                        products, raw-material, services it buys only to satisfy users. Rather, purchase
                                        standardization will be part of a broader strategy that includes ever more
                                        granular segmentation of vendor-bases. This will mean collecting data on your
                                        various vendors in order to segment them into different smaller groups so that
                                        you can be sure that your production and shipping workflows are specifically
                                        aiming to meet the needs of your organisation. </p>
                                    <p>In this way, businesses will be able to provide higher quality service and better
                                        adapt themselves to changing markets. As Negotiations changes and evolves, this
                                        will be one of the ways in which businesses can make sure that technological
                                        advances are being leveraged toward the ultimate goal of better providing for
                                        clients and customers. </p>
                                    <h5>6. Visibility – A Virtual Compulsion</h5>
                                    <p>While we’re on the topic of increased customer requirements: services like Amazon
                                        have set the bar a lot higher for tracking and shipment visibility, and those
                                        expectations are shifting even among B2B customers. People increasingly expect
                                        to know when a given shipment has completed each stage of its journey, just as
                                        they expect delivery dates to hue extremely closely to advanced estimates. For
                                        companies to offer this level of visibility to their customers, they’ll
                                        increasingly need to bolster visibility within their own Negotiations, taking a
                                        much more granular approach to tracking each product as its transformed from raw
                                        materials into a finished good and subsequently shipped to its final
                                        destination. This will require digitization and the adoption of IT solutions
                                        that help connect disparate points on the value chain—things that may seem
                                        onerous. But it will also help to drive a number of intra-operational benefits,
                                        from reduced silos to increased collaboration.</p>
